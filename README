NAME
    Kwiki::DatedAnnounce - Create a date sensitive section of output

SYNOPSIS
     $ cd /path/to/kwiki
     $ kwiki -install Kwiki::DatedAnnounce

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to wrap a section of wikitext to be displayed
    only after a certain time for an optional number of seconds. For
    example:

        .dated
        datespec: 1095056602 172800

        Hello, it's around Monday, September 13, 2004.
        .dated

    datespec is two numbers representing the number of seconds since the
    epoch and a duration in seconds. Duration defaults to zero if none is
    provided. Zero means infinite duration. If the time of the current
    display is within the window described by the datespec, the content will
    be displayed.

CREDITS
    This was my first plugin, trying to figure out what was going on. I've
    pulled it out of the dusty corners to make it go with Kwiki::Test
